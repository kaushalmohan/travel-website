2. The Indian Kitchen (Masoor Dal soup and Egg dosa - decent food)","1. Our first visit for the day was Bibikhanum mosque which was a 800m walk from our hotel. The mosque is absolutely stunning and we spent around three hours exploring the place. There are three structures to the mosque - one main mosque and two mosques on either side of the main mosque. We also got a guide (highly recommended) who showed us around the place and told us about the history. Spent about 4 hours there. 
2. Gur-I-Timur is the final resting place of Timur and is so so beautiful. We spend around two and a half hours here roaming around by ourselves and later we got a guide here as well who told us stories about Timur and the architecture. Getting a guide again highly recommended as otherwise a lot of the understanding of the place is lost. Spent about 3 hours there.","Bibikhanum mausaleum which is right opposite Bibikhanum mosque can be skipped ad it is just a room which has the tomb of Bibikhanum (the entry fees of 35,000 per person for this place is quite expensive)",Mostly walked around and took Yandex for some journeys,,,"1.

Entered at about 11 or so, but got to know at about 1130 that today being a Friday and a jummah day, it's closed from 12-3. Since it was going to close, we decided we didn't have enough time to explore fully and skipped it for the day. we decided we'll return the next day.  Spent only 30 min there since we were planning to return anyway. 
2. Afrosiab Settlement is a continously inhabited settlement from atleast 9th century BC. Genghis Khan burnt the place to the ground in 1220. There is a museum and the excavation site of the ancient settlement. The museum doesn't have too many good descriptions even though it has a number of great artifacts. This is the only place we didn't take a guide, and the site was difficult to figure out what stood where. Spent about 2 hours there.
3. Registan Square - Absolutely stunning, must vist for both a day and night view. We entered at 3 pm and were there until 830 pm. There is a light show at 8 pm which is very average - however the standard night view without the light show is better. We took a guide and it was extremely useful.  Highly recommend getting a guide. Spent 5.5 hours there.","Afrosiab settlement, in case you don't have enough time.

Most of the observatory is destroyed, but a museum has been created in it's place. There's a quarter of the observatory still preserved underground, which is fasincating. We took a guide - highly recommended. Spent about 2 hours there.
2. We visited Shahi Zinda next. Multiple tombs of Timuroid dynasty. The most important tomb however is that of Prophet Mohammed's cousin who brought Islam to Central Asia in 7th Century. The place is a must visit and shouldn't be skipped - it's so beautiful. It is difficult to find an English Speaking guide here. But if you find one, get one - they help.

2. Old Bukhara is a very walkable city - we really enjoyed walking around the city from our hotel to the Poi Kalan ensemble to the Arc of Bukhara, and to Lyabi Square. There is a great vibe and you really feel like you're walking around in an ancient silk road city.
3. We visited the Ark of bukhara and spent about 3-3.5 hours there. It's a fortress from the 5th century, and also contained some museums inside, like the history of bukhara, nature of bukhara, etc etc. The museums aren't well described, and unfortunately we weren't able to figure out which parts of the fortress were 5th Century constructions and which were 18th. A guide was needed but the only English speaking guide was busy. Without a guide, the only thing worth visiting in the ark is the view of the entire old town you get from the top. ","Ark of Bukhara, if you don't have enough time.",,,"Hotel Marhaba Boutique - Good hotel, good location, about a 10 min walk from Lyabi Khauze square and a 10 min walk from Poi Kalan ensemble. The walk gets a bit secluded in the night though. The hotel don't accept card payments which is a pain because we need to withdraw 200+ USD from the ATM.",Ark of Bukhara - 70000

2. old Bukhara (Lagman and fries - average food)
3. Coffee room (americano and cappucino)","1. Chor Minar was very chill and nice. It's not as big or intricate as the Hyderabad Charminar but has a lot of chill vibe surrounding it. There weren't too many tourists and we had a lot of time to sit around and stare at the minor. 
2. Abdul Aziz Madrasa is a nice madrasa that was incomplete on one side because the person building the madrasa went to Mecca and died onroute. there was a museum inside that can be skipped but you should visit the courtyard. 
3. LMaghak i Attori is the oldest religious site in Bukhara and is well preserved. There's a museum inside which we didn't enter.
4. Nodi Devon Begi Madrassa is beautiful from the outside but has a terrible museum inside. You can skip the museum.
5. Ulug Beg Madrasa is a wonderful madrasa bthat also has the calligraphy museum attached to it. It's a useless museum.
6. We went outside Kalon Minaret to soak in the vibe. ",All the museums in Bukhara are useless. They only have pots and pans and water pipes which arne't even labelled properly. They do not inspire awe unfortunately.,,,,"1. Abdul Aziz Madrasa - 20000 per head

The poi kalon complex is a must do and getting a guide is highly recommended. Do both day and night views of the minaret (minaret view is free)
2. We went to Zindon which is a prison from the late 1700s. This was relatively uneventful and can be skipped.
3. Ismail Somani Mausoleum - a building from 10th Century. This has very interesting history associated with it. it's a simple structure but is incredibly beautiful. There's a park nearb where you can chill as well. highly recommend.

2. Kukaldosh is a 5 min walk away from Chorsu Bazaar. While it's pretty and nice, it's not a patch on some of the other timuroid architecture we saw in samarkand and bukhara
3. We visited a few metro stations - Kosmonavtar, Alisher Navoi, Amir Timur, Pushkin - they were all so pretty and metro travel is extremely economical.
4. We walked around Tashkent City Park - looks like the pricey area of Tashkent. it was fun and had a good vibe. There is fountain show every half hour from 730 to 9.","Kukaldosh, assuming you've been to samarkand / bukhara

2. After that we spent some time in the Amir Temur Square which is a great park with the Temur statue. Great park to just walk around amongst the beautiful big trees with no agenda :)
3. We went to a couple more metro stations Oybek, Gafur Gulom, Tashkent, Mustakillik Maydoni which are absolutely stunning. We got off at these stations, admired them, took some pictures and took the train again to go to the next station.
4. Minor Mosque is a very new mosque in Tashkent with bright white tiles. It is quite beautiful inside out and we had a good time walking around the mosque.
5. Hazrati Imam complex has 2-3 structures one of which is a mosque. The most amazing portion of the complex is the tiny room in which the world's oldest Quran (apparently) is kept. It was fascinating to be in the presence of a book that was written 1400 years ago. We spent hours just looking at the book and talking and reading about it. 
5. We went to the Independence square but apparently it is closed on Saturday and Sunday so there was no vibe. ",,,,City Center,"Timur museum = 40000 UZS per head
