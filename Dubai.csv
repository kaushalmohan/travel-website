Introduction,We are documenting out Dubai travel here. A lot of Dubai itineraries are already available on the internet so instead of giving our day to day plan we will be talking about our Dubai experience in general
When did we travel and what was the weather like,We travelled to Dubai in the mid of October for 11 days and the weather was a bit hot in the afternoons. The weather in the mornings and evening was nice and pleasant. For us the most incredible part was going around the city like a local. We always opted for metros / buses over cabs and that really made us feel like a part of the city 
How did we get around in Dubai,"We mostly covered all of Dubai just by local transport. We took one or two cabs in our entire 11 days. We predominantly got around the city via metros, but we also took the bus, mono rail and abra rides. Getting around Dubai using just metros was quite easy as all the attractions are very well connected via metro"
How did we get metro tickets in Dubai,"Dubai has something called a NOL card. All one needs to do is get a NOL card in Dubai (which is easily available on any metro station) and load it. The entire metro network is divided in zones and how much will you get charged will depend on where you enter the netro station and where you exit. What is even more amazing is that you can use the same NOL card in buses and it works in exactly the same way. As you enter the bus you need to tap your card and then tap your card while exiting the bus and it's done! The same NOL card can be used for payment in tram, cabs and Abra rides as well. "
Where did we stay in Dubai,"As we had planned to travel in Dubai by metros mostly, we got all our accomodations close to a metro station (200-300m) from a metro station
- For the first part of our trip, we stayed in a hotel called Orchid Hotel Al Barsha which was 350m away from the Mashreq metro station. The hoel was clean, decently prices and served good breakfast every morning. We did not face any issues here in our 3 day stay.
- We then moved to the George Hotel by Saffron where we stayed for 4 days and even this station was just 400m from Al Ras metro station. The hotel was clean and well maintained, breakfast was okay and we did not face any issues as such. We ahd read in a lot of reviews that the hotel staff tries to extort the guests during check-out by claiming that the guests damaged the room but we did not face any such issue.

Finding a decent accomodation in Dubai turned out to be a challenge because most of the mid-range hotels had bad reviews on Google / Agoda. These two had decent reviews and were close to the metro station so we went for these and overall had a good experience"
What did we do in Dubai and how do we rate it,"JBR walk - It is a an upscale neighbourhood in Dubai which is about a 2km strip where people can walk around and eat in cafes. It is an amazing place to aimlessly stroll, rent cycles and cycle around and just chill without an agenda. We spent a few hours here and had a lot of fun. We also planned to return on another day but sadly could not. If we go to Dubai again, we are definitelt spending a lot of time here!
Five out of five stars"
,"Dhow Cruise dinner at marina - We took the dhow cruise which is a two hour ride in Dubai marina. We got a beautiful view of modern Dubai skyscrapers all lit at night as we cruised throuth the marina with food and music. The view was breathtaking, the view was great and we had a blast. A tip - the cruise is usually has a lower deck and an upper deck. For a great view opt for the upper deck which is open (upper deck tickets need to be booked specifically, else many times the providers give lower deck tickets).
Five out of five stars"
,"Museum of the Future - There is no doubt that it is the most uniquely designed building in the world! A must see both in the morning and in the evening after it lights up. The museum itself though felt a bit gimmicky and did not feel like it was very well planned. What we did enjoy was the display of the species DNA and how beautifully it was arranged. The terrace access also allowed us to get a good view of the Sheikh Zayad road and the view was amazing. Overall we are happy to have visited. A tip - Bankpacks are not allowed inside but they have secure facilities on the ground floor where one can leave their bags.
Three and a half stars out of five
Getting there - The nearest metro station is the Emirates Tower Station on the red line which has a covered walkway to the Museum of the Future"
,"View at the Palm - Took a monorail to get to the View at the Palm for the sunset view. The view of the Palm and Atlantis from the 52nd floor was amazing and once the sun went down we could see all the tall buildings beautifully lit up!
Four out of five stars"
,"Mall of the Emirates - This is the mall where the famous Ski Dubai is. Though we did not go inside, we could see people playing in snow and doing snow rides from the outside. The mall itself is quite huge with a lot of jewellery shops and high end shops. Totally skipable if one does not want to do Ski Dubai or shop in one of these super high-end shops.

Getting there - The nearest metro station is the Mall of the Emirates Station on the red line which has a covered walkway to the mall"
,"Desert Safari - We got picked up from our hotel for Desert Safari at around 2.30 PM and drove for about two hours (100 kms) to reach the Hamdan Desert Safari camp. Once there we waited for Dune bashing while other people did camel rides, ATV rides, etc. e later proceeded for Dune bashing for which we sat in a 4 by 4 all strapped in as our driver took us up and down the desert dunes for about 15-20 minutes after we reached a point which looked like the middle of nowhere where we clicked pictures did sandboarding and left for the camp. Onec at the camp we found a nice place to sit and enjoyed snacks and dinner with fire show, belly dance and Tanoura dance performance. 
Four out of five stars"
,"Kite Beach - We went to the kite beach in the morning and surprisingly it was not over crowded. The beach has clean shores, clear waters and stunning view of the Burj Al Arab. We spent hours walking in the clean waters and just chilling and relaxing on the beach
Five out of five stars
Getting there - 4 minute walk from Orchid Al Barsha to Insurance Market Metro Bus stop. Get off at Manara Enoc 2 bus stop and walk to the beach "
,"Dubai Frame - We went to Dubai Frame in the evening. It is a large frame and we went inside to the 48th floor from where one can getr good views of the city. It was a hazy day and we didn't get great views of the city. Overall an okay experience, however entirely skipable if going to Burj Khalifa.
Two and a half out of five stars
Getting there - In all the attractions in Dubai, getting to Dubai by public transport was the most difficult. It is not well connected by metro or bus and getting a cab might be the best idea."
,"Burj Khalifa - The tallest building in the world is totally worth the hype! We visited Burj Khalifa in the morning and took the high speed elevator to the 124th floor and reached the 124th floor in about a minute. The 124th and 125th floor give an amazing view of the city and it was almost difficult to believe how up we were! We spent hours here taking in the views of the Sheikh Zayad road, watching the metros go by. The entire area is full of high rises and yet the Burj Khalifa makes every single building there look tiny. It a am experience one must not miss when in Dubai.
Five out of five stars
Getting there - 4 minute walk from the George hotel by Saffron to Al Ras Metro station. Change fron Green line to red line at Burjuman metro station and ride to Burj Khalifa / Dubai Mall metro station. A covered walkway of about 700m to the Dubai mall. "
,"Dubai Aquarium and underwater zoo - Dubai Aquarium is inside Dubai Mall itself. We spent about three hours in Dubai Aquarium, and it was very fascinating. There were a lot of different variants of water creatures in Dubai Aquarium, ranging from these pretty beautiful fish to large crocodiles. The crocodile in Dubai aquarium is over 5 meters long and weighs 750 kgs, it's absolutely massive. There also is a Penguin Cove in Dubai Aquarium. There are also desert animals within Dubai Aquarium in a dry section. That was also very interesting. 
3.5 out of 5 stars
Getting there. This is inside Dubai Mall itself. The easiest way to reach there is just getting off at the Dubai Mall Metro Station. "
,"Dubai Fountain Show - the Dubai Fountain Show happens within Dubai Mall, right outside in the lake near the mall. It is absolutely breathtaking and is a must-watch. There Is a Fountain Show every half an hour starting at 7 pm in Dubai Mall. during the fountain show, even all of Burj Khalifa will light up. This is mind-blowing, and we went and watched the fountain show four times in our trip. 
5/5 stars 
Getting There: This is inside Dubai Mall itself. The easiest way to reach there is getting off at Dubai Mall Metro Station. "
,"Miracle Garden - Miracle Garden is a giant garden outside Dubai city. It is closer to Global Village than the city itself, so it makes sense to do Miracle Garden and Global Village on the same day. It is large, beautiful, funky, and very, very well maintained. there is a large Emirates plane inside. We spent about three hours here. 
3/5 stars
Getting there. This is quite far away from Dubai. We took a bus to Miracle Garden - This was bus F36 which is available from Mall of the Emirates station. We took our train from Al Ras Metro Station all the way to Mall of the Emirates, and then we took the bus from there. It was about a 45-minute bus ride from Mall of the Emirates. "
,"Global Village - Global Village was absolutely magical. It is one of those places where we ended up getting so exhausted from all the walking around and all the things to see that we weren't able to complete the entire space. There were individual country stalls for more than 30 countries in Global Village. We had so much fun exploring each of the stalls, eating random samples of food from each country, viewing the souvenirs, crockery, and exhibits in each country. . We entered Global Village at about 5:00 pm or so and we were there all the way until 12:00 am. 
5/5 stars
Getting there: We went from Miracle Garden directly to Global Village and we took a cab. Global village is quite far away from the city and if you are to reach global village on your own you can get a bus there. While leaving we got the last bus back from Global Village back towards Bur Dubai at 1 am. "
,"Spice Souk - Spice Souk was so much fun! In Spice Souk, you get all forms of spices, of course, but also dry fruits, fruits, souvenirs. The shopkeepers allow you to taste all their products. We went there three times because it was just so much fun to walk around that place. After a point, the shopkeepers stopped calling us because they recognized us! Highly recommend going to Spice Souk. 
5/5 stars
Getting there: This is very easily accessible if you are in Burj Dubai. You can just walk directly from Al Ras Metro Station "
,"Gold Souk - Gold Souk was a real sight. Never had we ever seen such mannequins wearing lots of gold jewelry all out there available straight on the road without any security. It was very fascinating to see how much jewelry people and tourists were buying. The area was filled with Indians buying jewelry. 
4/5 stars
Getting there: directly walkable from Gold Souk metro station itself. We walked from our hotel George Saffron because again it was only about 800 meters. "
,"Sky View Dubai - the Sky View Dubai is one of the few publicly accessible buildings which gives you a view of the Burj Khalifa from a height. It was beautiful, and we got very nice views of the entire city from the Sky Observatory. The other great fun part of the Sky View is a glass slide which enables you to slide from the 53rd floor to the 52nd floor - This can be quite scary, but we had a lot of fun. The Sky Observatory is very skippable if You aren't an absolute nerd when it comes to city views - if you have already gone all the way up to the Burj Khalifa and seen the Dubai skyline from the top there, Then you don't really need to do the Sky Observatory. There is also an edge walk on the Sky Observatory where you can actually walk on the edge of the building in open air with a harness. We did not do this, but a lot of people did. 
4/5 stars
Getting there: Very easily accessible - directly get off at Burj Khalifa metro station (5-minute walk from there). "
,"Museum of Illusions - We did the Museum of Illusions on our last day in Dubai - honestly because we didn't have much else to do. This is a museum filled with illusions. There were physics-based, science-based, and mirror-based illusions, and we had so much fun just playing around with each of them. We spent about two hours in this museum and took a lot of funny pictures. 
4/5 stars
Getting there: We took a boat from Al Fahidi Boat Station to Deira Old Souk Boat Station. It was a 5-minute walk from the Deira Boat Station. "
