We walked end to end on the bridge just soaking in the vibe. There were college kids chilling nearby, playimg games and having a laugh which was fun to watch. The dragon bridge breathes fire every Saturday and Sunday at 9 PM so if you are in Da Nang on those days, plan accordingly.

"Day 9
Friday",Flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh city,"1. Secret weapon cellar
2. Explore Ho Chi Minh Square",1. Namaste Indian Restaurant ,"The secret weapon cellar is a house in Ho Chi Minh City where the Vietnamese army used to store their weapons. It is a regular house which actually has a secret cellar which is completely invisible. It was super fun to search for the cellar, open the cellar, and then subsequently go down under the ground to see actual weapons being stolen. There also is a cafe attached to the house, and if you buy a coffee in that cafe, you can explore the entire house. The entire house has a lot of secret passageways and tunnels, and it's a lot of fun to explore. I was mind-blown. 
Ho Chi Minh Square is an absolute vibe - it's this vast, walkable area where people come and chill in the evenings. You should definitely visit it, especially post 7:30 in the evening because there will be a lot of street artists there, there will be a lot of random people selling you stuff. There are lots of cafes to eat around it. It's a genuinely interesting experience. ","Don't skip either, both were very fun ",,"The Mekong Delta Tour is a full-day tour away from Ho Chi Minh City. We didn't do it because it would consume an entire day, and we didn't think we had the time. 

",
"Day 10
Saturday",Explore Ho Chi Minh City,"1. Go for a trip to Cu Chi tunnels
2. Visit Landmark 81 (tallest building in Ho Chi Minh city)",,"Cu Chi Tunnels is a half-day trip away from Ho Chi Minh City. It is a network of underground tunnels which were used by the Vietnamese army to stave off the Americans. On the tour to Cu Chi Tunnels, the guide will basically walk you through the entire tunnel network. He'll help you discover a few of these invisible openings to tunnels in the middle of the forest. If you'd like, you can also enter some of these tunnels. There are tunnels of varying lengths (30m, 100m, and 200m). most people do 30-meter tunnels. The 100m and 200m tunnels do genuinely feel long. The tunnels are very, very small, and if you're claustrophobic, you should probably see a few videos of the tunnels before going in. 
Landmark 81 is the tallest building in Ho Chi Minh city and we went for the city view during sunset. The area around Landmark 81 in the bottom is fun, people just sit and chill on the floor. ","If you are not interested in stalled cityscapes in views from the top of a city, then you can skip landmark 81. ",,,

It was extremely interesting for us, and we spent over four hours there. .
We then went to the Ho Chi Minh post office or the Saigon post office, which was a beautiful old building that was fully functional as a post office. There are a lot of places to buy souvenirs and postcards in the post office itself. The Pink Church is right near the post office. 
Lastly, we went to Bui Vien street which  is a night walking street with lots of crowd and night life. The walking street had people carrying snakes around their neck. and had a lot of active nightlife","If you're not interested in war-related history, you can skip the war museum.
