Al Bustan Village
Nizwa Souk","The dolphin cruise was stunning. Saw a lot of dolphins, over 100 of them, in the turquoise blue waters of Marina Bandar, Rawdha. Very close to the Marina is Al Bustan village, which is a beautiful white and blue village inspired by Santorini. It makes for great photo spots and has a very nice vibe to it. 

We then drove all the way to Nizwa, which was a great drive. Didn't really expect the barren nature of Oman to be as pretty as it was. 

We then spent some time in the Nizwa Souk just absorbing the sights and sounds of it. It was quite late in the evening by the time we reached. We entered the sweet souk which has the Omani as well as the non-Omani sweets and tasted a lot of halwas. Finally, we decided that the tahini halwa was our favorite. 

Our accommodation was within Nizwa Souk, which made access to Nizwa Souk, Nizwa Fort, and Nizwa Castle incredibly easy. We just have to walk within Nizwa, and I highly, highly recommend staying within the souk itself.

Nizwa souk","Every Friday in Nizwa there is a Goat Market early in the morning between 7 to 11. This Goat Market involves a lot of the villagers and shepherds around Nizwa city bringing in their goats and cattle for sale. It was truly a wonderful sight looking at all the cows and goats for sale. Buyers and sellers would accumulate in a single place where buyers would sit around in a circle while sellers would parade their goats within the circle, and sales would be made based on handshakes and exchange of money. It was exceptionally fascinating, and I highly recommend you visit this Goat Market if you are in Nizwa on Fridays.

Once we were done with the Goat Market, we went to Alhuta Caves. Alhuta Caves is an absolutely fascinating cave which contains naturally formed stalactites and stalagmites millions of years old. The caves have been well marked for tourists, and there are a lot of tiny boards with stalactite-related trivia outside the caves, making it a fascinating walk. 

From Alhoota caves, we drove to a nearby village called Bahla which has a fascinating fort called Bahla Fort. It's coupled with a historical mosque called Bahla Historical Mosque, and we spent a fair bit of time there as well. This fort is not very well marked and would have been better if we had a guide with us. Nevertheless, we spent about 3-4 hours there. We struggled to find vegetarian food in and around Bahla. Once we were done with Bahla Fort, we drove back to Nizwa and spent about an hour exploring the souk again. ",,,"Near Bahla Fort, there is Jabreen Castle which is supposedly a very nice castle.

We hired a guide here, and having a guide was exceptionally useful because of all the additional trivia that he was able to give us. The fort in itself and the castle were not very well labeled or marked, so the guide was super helpful. 

From Nizwa Fort we went to the mountain village of Misfat Al Abriyeen. In this village, we did walk around the narrow lanes. I was genuinely beautiful. While we were walking around the marked trails, we started hiking. It turned quite dark, quite quickly. We got a bit scared because we felt like we were in the middle of nowhere with no humans around us, and the evening was becoming darker. Luckily, we found our way out almost 2 kilometers outside the village and had to walk those 2 kilometers back towards the village to where our parking was. 

We then ate a small meal in a super charming cafe called Rogan cafe at the village The cafe was all vibes. I highly recommend eating the Rogan Crepe.

From Misfat Al-Abriyeen, we drove to the village of Al-Hamra where we stayed in an old Omani house. The house was so charming, and we wish we had spent more time here. It truly gave us the feeling of what living in an Omani house would be like.  ","If you are only doing a 4-5 day trip and are short on time, you can completely skip Misfat Al-Abeeriyin - However, we enjoyed it a lot and it was a very nice detour.

16-Nov-2025,Sunday,Ras Al Hadd Village,"Drive ~4.5 hrs toward Sur
Stop at Wadi Bani Khalid for swim
Evening turtle tour at Ras Al Jinz",,"This morning, we checked out of the Alhamra old house after having a slow morning there. We then started our 3.5 to 4 hour drive towards Wadi Bani Khalid Which was a wonderful drive on extremely smooth roads. We reached Wadi Bani Khalid, and there are basically two options over there. One can either choose to walk/hike to the end of the wadi or choose to swim in the beautiful emerald pools there. We decided to hike through the Wadi and reach the end point. So we started our walk and continued to walk for a while until we reached Mukal cave. It is a very tiny cave, and it was fascinating to see that there are some highly adventurous people who actually crawl through the cave and get on to the other side. We didn't see anybody going through the cave, but we could see headlights and some gear kept there for those adventurous people who would want to crawl through the cave and go on the other side. We didn't do that. Have we continued To walk further and further into the wadi and manage to reach a point that actually seemed like it was the end of the wadi. It was just us and another couple who were in that area. It was about 5-ish in the evening when the sun had started to set. We decided to not explore any further and return back. It was a really fun walk, but we would also recommend people who love water to swim in the emerald pools there. It would have been amazing. 

We then had an early dinner at a place near Wadi Bani Kali itself and started our second long drive for the day towards Ras al Jinz. It was a wonderful drive, and as we approached Rasaljans for about 50 km, there were no street lights. The reason behind that is that the Rasaljans area is a protected turtle reserve, and all the lights in the night are put off to make it friendly for the turtles to come to the beach and lay their eggs. If there is any light, the turtles will not come to the beach, and to ensure that the turtles do come to the beach and lay their eggs, all of the lights in the Ras al Jinz area are put off. We drove for about 50 km with zero street lights and almost no other vehicles on the road. It was a great experience driving in the extreme darkness. We then reached Russell's Jeans Turtle Reserve, and it's quite fascinating how the whole system works there. There were a lot of people there to watch the turtle hatching. The way Russell Gins manages it is by giving coupons to people and putting them in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, with about 30 people in each of the groups. You don't pay until they are sure that a turtle has come to the beach and you will be able to have a sighting of the turtle laying eggs, covering the eggs, or some part of the entire experience. We were in Group 4 and we waited for about 1-1.5 hours. Initially, all the groups were waiting, and then the rangers confirmed that there was one turtle on the beach. She had come to lay her eggs and she had decided to lay eggs.

Interesting part here is that a turtle will try to look for an area and she may decide not to lay her eggs and move on to a second area. She may then decide to lay her eggs there or not. And if she decides not to lay her eggs in the second area, she will move on to a third spot and then she will decide whether she wants to lay her eggs there or not. In our case, the turtle had decided not to lay her eggs in the first and the second try. And in the third try, she decided to lay her eggs in the third place. If the turtle does not lay eggs in the third try, she will not lay eggs that night and she will go back to the ocean that night. However, this particular turtle decided to lay eggs in the third area that she had chosen. The group started going one-by-one, and finally, when our chance arrived, we went and saw the turtle covering her eggs, which is about a 40-minute to 1-hour long process for her. Once she was done covering the eggs, we saw her walk back to the sea. Very interestingly, she will never see her babies. She will then go around the sea, go to Pakistan, India, Maldives, Seychelles, go all around, and come back to this very beach in the next three to five years to lay her eggs again. She was about 55 years old at this point. It was an extremely fascinating experience. We also saw two baby turtles who were hatched that very day and they were trying to make their way back to the ocean. It was a very emotional and sentimental experience for us. Luckily, we also saw some planktons that night, which is something that we had not at all planned for. But we were very, very lucky to see some plankton that night as well. This sky was also exceptionally pretty on this day because of the number of stars we could see. Since Ras al Jinn is a protected reserve, there is a lot of darkness around and barely any light pollution, which meant that we were able to see thousands of stars in the sky.

Sur Souk","We drove from our Airbnb at Ras Al Had village To Sur village. At Sur, the first thing that we did was went to a dhow factory where actual canoes and dhows were being made by hand. We could see the craftsmen at work there with them working on carvings for hinges, ship doors, and interiors. We spent about two hours at the Thao factory and subsequently went to the marine museum within the Dhow factory itself. The museum was quite fascinating and very well labeled, which led us to spend about an hour or so just exploring the different sea routes that old sea traders used to follow.

From the Dhow factory, we then went for lunch, eating at an old Bangladeshi uncle's place, excellent roti and mixed vegetable. From there, we went to Al-Ajyah Watchtower. The watchtower requires a small hike up a tiny uphill mountain, but the views are worth the hike. We spent about three hours or so at the watchtower to see the entire Sur city both before the sunset as well as after, and see the city light up in the night. A lot of people go to the Al-Ajyah lighthouse, but the watchtower is a significantly better place to watch the sunset from. 

From the watchtower, we drove back towards the Sur Corniche, got an expensive coffee in a cafe full of vibes, and subsequently went to Sur Souq. Sur Souq was a very sad souq compared to the souqs that we had already seen in Mutra and Nizwa and is entirely skippable. We ate Pani Puri in Sur Souq which really wasn't Pani Puri at all because it did not have pani in it. 

From Sur Souq, we then went back to the Airbnb where we planned to go to the beach and subsequently view the stars in the plankton again. The beach was absolutely pitch dark, and therefore, there was a very high possibility of viewing plankton and stars. However, as we were approaching the beach, an official patrolling the beach told us that the beach is closed. We knew this (our airbnb guy had told us to tell any patroller that we were unaware in case they stop us)

We set up our tripod not directly at the beach but a short distance away from the beach on the sand itself trying to get pictures of a few stars. While we weren't very successful in getting pictures, the sky was truly filled with innumerable stars and it was a great watch. Super disappointed not to get to the water itself because we're sure we would have seen great plankton on this day.","Al-Ajyah Lighthouse can be skipped - the watchtower is a significantly better view

18-Nov-2025,Tuesday,Muscat,"Wadi Shab
Check in to Golden Tulip Muscat",Wadi Shab,"We drove from our Airbnb at Ras Al Had village to Wadi Shab. We had done a fair bit of research about Wadi Shab, especially because it involves a certain amount of wading through fairly deep waters, and neither of us are good swimmers. The pictures looked super exciting, and we really wanted to go all the way in! It took us a fair bit of time to drive to Wadi Shab, and we only made it there by about 11am. We rented life jackets for 1 OMR per life jacket just at the parking zone itself. The guy we rented the life jacket from was very nice because it never felt like he was trying to oversell us anything. We spotted waterproof phone holders in his shop, but we already had bought phone holders on Swiggy Instamart before the trip. We showed it to him, and he said that you really don't need to buy mine. Once we took the boat across the river to get to the trekking part of Wadi Shab. We began the 45-50 minute long trek. There were quite a few people, so finding the path was very easy. However, if there aren't too many people, the path can get confusing. Especially because there aren't too many markings. Once we got to the point where we saw the water area start, we left our bag at the backdrop zone, put on our life jackets, and subsequently got into the water. It was cold. We slowly waded through the water while we could walk through it, however it started becoming much deeper very quickly and Pankhuri freaked out a little. 
However, we met another Indian couple who had brought a guide, and the guide taught Pankhuri and me how to float using the life jacket in water and how to move around while floating. That technique significantly helped, and we were able to wade through the water albeit quite slowly. But we were able to wade through and appreciate all the sounds, sights, and smells of Wadi Shab.

By the time we were done and back towards the parking, it was almost 3:00 pm. Being in the water is extremely tiring, and we were exceptionally hungry. So we then drove up to a small restaurant called Anwar Tiwi Restaurant in the village of Tiwi, which seemed to be one of the few places where we could find vegetarian food. We ate at Anwar Tiwi and subsequently drove from Wadi Shab towards Muscat.

We had originally planned to also do Bimmah sinkhole and Tiwi beach on this day. However, because the sun sets so early and Wadi Shab took a fair amount of time, we were not able to do either of those. We decided to visit back the next day to do these two things.

Bimmah Sinkhole
Tiwi Beach","Today, we decided to go to Sultan Gubu's Grand Mosque. This mosque is only open between 8am and 11am for non-Muslims, therefore we needed to wake up quite early to reach the mosque. We were at the mosque by about 9:15am or so, and we got a guided tour within the mosque. The guide was an extremely friendly Omani uncle who gave us a lot of information about the mosque and Islam and Muscat and Oman. We were very happy to take a guide there at this mosque.

We saw this mosque contains the second-largest hand-woven carpet in the world, and after seeing this, we realized that we have now seen both the largest as well as the second-largest hand-woven carpets in the world, the largest of course being in the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi

Given that we were done with the mosque by about 11am, we decided we would then go back to TV to see what we had missed out on the previous day, the Bhima sinkhole and subsequently the TV beach. The Bimmah sinkhole is a giant sinkhole which is connected naturally to an underground source of water. There were quite a few Europeans at the Bimmah sinkhole who were swimming at the sinkhole. However, we heard that the water is extremely deep at the deeper ends. Almost 20 meters. It's a good place to just sit by and relax and get a pedicure by getting your feet nibbled at by fish. This is an entirely skippable place if you don't have the time. 

Post the Bimmah sinkhole, we went back towards Tiwi Village and ate at a restaurant right opposite Alnwar Tiwi. From there, we then drove down to Tiwi Beach. Tiwi Beach is an extremely calm, clean, and relatively isolated beach, and we spent almost two hours here watching the Sun set. It was a beach filled with pebbles and not sand. This was amongst the more peaceful experiences we had on the trip, and we absolutely loved just sitting around and doing nothing, looking at the crystal-clear waters hit the shoreline.

We then drove back from Tiwi Beach to Muscat, which was about an hour and a half. Had dinner and crashed. ",,,,Golden Tulip Al Khuwair Muscat,"Sultan Quboos Guide - 10 OMR

20-Nov-2025,Thursday,Muscat,Damaniyat Islands,Damaniyat Islands,"Today, we had booked a half-day tour of damaniyat Islands. damaniyat Islands is called the Maldives of Oman. It is a set of 100 odd small islands off the coast of Muscat which are very famous for stunning wildlife like turtles, sharks, schools of fishes, corals and brilliant turquoise blue waters. We booked a tour that would take us to damaniyat Islands, enable snorkeling two different places and stop by at one of the islands to see the views of the sea and the horizon from a height.

Our guide Fahad, who is the captain of the boat, it took about 40 minutes on a fairly calm boat ride to get to our first stop. While we were on the boat ride, Fahad kept stopping and pointing us to random turtles in the ocean, and we were very excited to see those.

At the first stop, Fahad told us that pointed to a spot and told us that a lot of turtles, sharks, and fish can be seen if we snorkeled at this spot. It was our first time snorkeling, so Fahad helped us out, taught us how to snorkel, and also gave us a tube to help us float along with the life jacket. Took us a bit of time to figure things out, but as we started getting more and more confident to put our heads under water and snorkel, we started seeing magnificent sea wildlife. The water was so crystal clear, and there were a very large number of turtles freely swimming around. It was an incredible sight, and we spent about half an hour to 40 minutes just exploring the sights and sounds of the open sea. 

From there, Fahad took us near an island and anchored the boat. Everyone got off the boat, and Fahad showed us a path towards a tiny hill top on the island from where we saw beautiful views of the surrounding islands and the open sea. From there, we just snorkeled near the beach for a bit, where we saw incredible coral reefs and a lot of jellyfish and regular fish as well. Again, being in the water was quite tiring, and we were exhausted by the time we were done. The overall tour lasted about four hours or so, and we were back on the coast by about 2:30 pm. We were both extremely tired and we drove back to the hotel by about 3 and decided to have lunch, and take a short nap. We set the alarm for 5 pm, but when we actually woke up, it turned out to be 10 pm. We ordered dinner, went back to sleep, and woke up the next day only at 7 am.

21-Nov-2025,Friday,Muscat,"Figure out how to buy life jackets and then get to Wadi Hoquin. 

Went to Mutrah Souk to buy souvenirs",Wadi Hoqein,"By this time, we'd been to two other wadis: Wadi Bani Khalid and Wadi Shaab. We'd also spent some time in the water in Damanyat, and we were really enjoying this whole water vacation that we had.

So, we decided we'd go to Wadi Hokain. The only problem, though, was that Wadi Hokain was not a very commercial wadi, so we weren't sure if we would get life jackets there. We asked around and discovered that there is only one shop in Wadi Hokain which provides life jackets. So, we didn't want to take the risk, especially given that it is almost a two-hour drive away from Muscat.

We wondered what to do and after a bit of searching around for life jackets on rent, we eventually ended up buying two life jackets for 12 OMR in total at a Hyper Max. By the time we were done with all of this life jacket hunting, it already was about 12 pm, and we then headed to Wadi Hokain at about 1:30 pm and reached there only by about 2:30 pm or so.

Wadi Hokain was a surreal experience. As we walked into the wadi, the water started getting very deep very quickly. It was turquoise blue to begin with, but slowly we were able to see that the color of the wadi was changing, and towards the end of the wadi, it became this stunning sulphur blue. It was a completely different blue to any other water that we had ever seen in our lives, and we were so happy to have made that impromptu decision to go to Wadi Hokain.

We had a bit of snacks at the coffee shop near Wadi Hokain at about 5:00 pm or so, and then left from there towards the city. On the way back to the city, given that we now had bought two additional life jackets, we realized the existing luggage we had would not suffice. However, on the morning of the same day itself, while we were searching for life jackets, we came across drag bags that we were able to get at 2 OMR, which is under 500 rupees. So we went back to the shop where we could buy those drag bags, bought one single drag bag, and then headed to Mutrah souq to buy souveniers",,,,Golden Tulip Al Khuwair Muscat,

Drive ~3.5 hrs to Wahiba Sands
Check-in & sunset, do timepass on sand dunes
Overnight desert camp.",,"We had started approaching the end of our trip and we started getting really sad. This was a really tangible end on this day because this was the day we returned our Nissan Sunny, the 2WD, after it had been with us for about 10 days and had covered about 1965 km. Our car rental guy came to our hotel in the morning, along with a 4x4 Mitsubishi Montero Sport, which would be our car for the next three days of our trip. We needed the 4x4 as we were planning to go into the desert today and to the mountain Jebel Akhtar tomorrow. It was my first time driving a 4x4, and the car was truly massive.

It took a little bit of time to get adjusted to driving the Montero Sport, but we headed towards the desert. Wahiba Sands was about 3.5 hours away.

Once we landed at the meeting point at Wahiba Sands, we made the payment for our tent and our guide came along to show us the route to the actual tent itself we will be staying at. He also deflated our tires. Then he told us where to use the 4WD mode and where to not use it, and we followed him into the desert. It was a 7 km drive to the tent, most of it on pure sand without any road at all. It was very exciting driving on the sand, and the last km or so was a drive up and down on sand dunes itself which was very new to me. Once we reached the sand dunes and got to our tent, we parked right next to it. The tent was very simple - it really was just a tent with a flap for a door and an attached bathroom which was open to the sky. It had one bed and one cupboard and nothing more. We immediately dumped our stuff into some basic stuff into the tent and started walking towards the sand dunes. There was also a place near the tents to get tea and dates, so we sat there for a while. Subsequently, we walked up and down the sand dunes to get different views of the desert and it was truly stunning. 

Walking up the dunes was very challenging purely because of how incredibly sandy the sand was and how much wind was blowing at that point. For about an hour or so we braved the wind and walked around the sands. By about 6:30 pm or so it became very dark, and at 7 pm, our guides Badar and Abdul Malik set up a campfire. There were only two other tents which had guests out of the seven different tents at the camp today. The other guests were a couple from Czechoslovakia, a couple from Germany, and one from Austria. I was the only guy.

Amongst all the guests, on that day, everyone sat around the camp and our guides talked a lot about their childhood growing up in the Bedouin culture, the difficulties that Bedouins face, and it was very interesting.

At 7:30, we had dinner, which was a wide spread of food with a lot of vegetarian options, including fries, rice, falafel, rolls, and salad. It was a very good dinner, and post-dinner, everyone again assembled around the campfire to continue listening to our guides' stories. By about 10:30 or so, everyone dispersed.

Post viewing the sunrise, we went back to sleep since we had only slept for a short period of time the previous night. We then followed it up with a great breakfast where we discovered that honey and cheese with bread is a great combination. Subsequently, we checked out at about 10:30 in the morning, drove towards the town of Bidiyah, filled air in our tires, and then decided to head towards Jebel Akhbar. However, on the way in the town of Bidiyah, we saw a sweet shop and decided to pick up halwa for folks at office. This sweet shop we had did not have the kind of halwa we wanted, but he suggested us to go to a different shop.

When we entered the other shop, there were only packeted halwas there, and we didn't know which one to buy. So we bought one small halwa, went outside, sat in the car, ate the halwa, liked it, and then went back into the shop to buy the same halwa again. The shopkeeper judged us. From there, we decided to drive all the way to Jebel Akhtar, which was a 4.5hr drive. We stopped on the way for lunch at a Pakistani restaurant where the food was absolutely fantastic, but the owner definitely charged us a tourist tax. From there, we continued to drive towards Jebel, and we only stopped at the foothills of Jebel to get a coffee before driving up the mountains. 

We were stopped at the entry point of Jebel by a policeman to double-check our license and validate that we had a four-wheel drive. The roads were quite steep, and it took a bit of time for us to adjust to driving on those steep roads with the four-wheel drive. However, the secret was to eventually move to manual mode, and driving in manual was an easier drive than driving in automatic. 

We went to diana's point, supposedly the point where Princess Diana visited when she was here with Prince Charles. They were in Oman at the time, and apparently she read a book and Prince Charles painted a painting. From there, we went to a mountain village called Al Ain village which is an inhabited village with some very pretty, quaint hiking paths. From here, we went back to the hotel, checked in, and then went to have dinner in a place with a really nice ambience. 

The more time we spent at Jebel, the more we realized that if (given that we had spent so much time in beautiful Western Ghats landscapes like Coorg, Ooty, Coonoor, Wayanad, and so on), Jebel was entirely skippable. We also made a really silly mistake. We thought that Jebel Akhtar was the tallest point of Oman, but in fact, it was Jebel Shams.

We woke up at the hotel, had breakfast (which was a very poor spread), checked out, and then started the drive back towards Muscat. At the foothills of Javil Akhtar, we stopped by an abandoned old village called Birkhat Al Mauj. This village was abandoned in the late 1980s despite being inhabited for over 500 to 700 years prior to that. The reason the village was abandoned was because it was made for olden day transport (donkey-sized roads) as opposed to new age transport (car-sized roads). The village was quite fascinating because as you walked through the village, you could see the outlines of houses and the internal architecture of each of the houses with respect to bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms, and so on. You could also imagine what a closed village life would look like. From there, we drove back towards Muscat and reached Muscat at about 2:30 pm or so. 
We first had lunch at Kamath and from there we headed towards Royal Opera House where we intended to stop for just about 10-15 minutes for a photo stop. It was genuinely beautiful and glistening white, and we ended up spending about 30 minutes or so there.

We parked near Mutra Fort, not at Mutra Fort because we didn't get parking, but parked near Mutra Fort and then climbed all the way up. 2.5 hours or so at Mutra Fort which gave us a very beautiful view of the Mutra Corniche along with a sunset view over the city itself. It was very pretty. Post that, we looked at our itinerary and saw what all we've missed. Turns out we hadn't gone to the Al-Jalali/Al-Mirani forts and the Al-Mirani viewpoint. Since they were only about 5-10 minutes away from the fort itself, we decided to drive towards these points and did a quick photo stop at these points. From these points, we then went across back to the parking at Nizwa at Mutra Souq and spent the next two hours or so just aimlessly walking around the souq. It genuinely felt like our trip was coming to an end, especially because we didn't have much to do at that point and we were just sitting in staring sadly into the sea. We then drove back towards Kamath where we had dinner again and then drove to the airport returned a 4WD, took a flight, and came back home. It was a great trip. ","If you don't have time, you can actually skip Al-Jalali, Al-Mirani, and Al-Alam Palace","It's advisable to do Al Jalali, Al Mirani, and Al Alam palace during the day when there is light since you can see it better. There is also the Al Jalali viewpoint which would have been great to just sit and chill at during sunset - it's exactly like Marine Drive in Mumbai but just much more chill and empty. ",We really wanted to go to a viewpoint called Yeti Viewpoint but we ended up not going because of lack of time. That is also best done during sunset,"No Stay today, we lived out of our car.
