          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We're Pankhuri and Kaushal, a couple with an insatiable wanderlust and a shared passion for experiencing the world at our own pace. Our journey began when we met in college and discovered our mutual love for travel and adventure.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            After years of rushed vacations and checking destinations off a list, we realized that we weren't truly experiencing the places we visited. That's when we decided to embrace "slow travel" â€“ a mindful approach that allows us to immerse ourselves in local cultures, forge meaningful connections, and create lasting memories.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            This blog is our way of documenting our journeys and sharing our experiences with fellow travelers who believe that travel is not just about the destinations, but about the journey and the stories we collect along the way.

              <p class="text-gray-600">
                We believe in spending more time in fewer places, allowing us to develop a deeper connection with each destination. Rather than rushing from one tourist attraction to another, we prefer to wander through local neighborhoods, sit in cafes, and observe daily life.

                Some of our most memorable experiences have come from conversations with locals. We make an effort to learn basic phrases in the local language, stay in family-run accommodations, and participate in community activities whenever possible.
